Chapter-1:
==========1.5==============
What is Java?
Ans. Java is a powerful and versatile programming language for developing software 
running on mobile devices, desktop computers, and servers.

Who introduces Java programming? Describe.
Ans. Java was developed by a team led by James Gosling 
at Sun Microsystems. Sun Microsystems was purchased by Oracle in 2010. 
Originally called Oak, Java was designed in 1991 for use in embedded chips in consumer
 electronic appliances. 
In 1995, renamed Java, it was redesigned for developing Web applications. For the history of 
Java, see www.java.com/en/javahistory/index.jsp

What is Platform Independent?
Ans. write from one os and run anywhere.

What are main features of Java?
Ans. Java is Simple,object oriented,distributed,multiprogramming, multithreading,
multiprocessing,interpreted,robust,secure,architecture  neutral,portable,high  
performance,multi-threaded, and dynamic.
 
Describe Java language.
Ans.Java is a full-featured, general-purpose programming language that can be used to 
develop robust mission-critical applications. 
Today, it is employed not only for Web programming but also for developing standalone
 applications across platforms on servers, desktop computers, and  mobile  devices. 

It  was  used  to  develop  the  code  to  communicate  with  and  control  the  
robotic rover on Mars. 


What is Java applet?
 Ans. Applets  employ  a  modern  graphical  interface  with  but- tons, text fields,
 text areas, radio buttons, and so on, to interact with users on the Web and 
process their requests. Applets make the Web responsive, interactive, and fun to use.
 Applets are embedded in an HTML file. 

What is HTML?
Ans. (Hypertext Markup Language) is a simple scripting language for laying out documents, 
linking documents on the Internet, and bringing images, sound, and video alive on the Web.
 
Describe rich Internet appli-cations.
 Ans. Today, you can use Java to develop rich Internet appli-cations. A rich Internet 
 application (RIA) is a Web application designed to deliver the same 
features and functions normally associated with deskop applications.

What is the cause behind the popularity for developing applications using Java?
Ans. Java is now very popular for developing applications on Web servers. These applications 
process  data,  perform  computations,  and  generate  dynamic  Web  pages.  Many  commercial  
Websites are developed using Java on the backend. 

Is Java a versatile programming language? Why?
Ans. Yes, Java is a versatile programming language: you can use it to develop applications for
 desk-top computers, servers, and small handheld devices. The software for Android cell
 phones is developed using Java. 

Who invented Java? Which company owns Java now?
Ans. Java was invented by a team led by James Gosling 
at Sun Microsystems. Sun Microsystems was purchased by Oracle in 2010. 

What programming language does Android use?
Ans. Java
=================1.6 =============== , API, JDK, and IDE
What is the Java Language Specification?
Ans.Java syntax is defined in the Java language specification. Java  language  
specification  is  a  technical  definition  of  the  Java  programming  
language’s syntax and semantics.

What is Java library?
Ans. Java library is defined in the Java API.

What is the JDK?
Ans. JDK stands for Java Development Kit. The JDK is the software for developing and running Java 
programs. 

What is IDE?
Ans. An IDE is an integrated development environment for rapidly developing programs.
Computer languages have strict rules of usage. If you do not follow the rules when writing a 
program, the computer will not be able to understand it. 

Who define java Standards?
Ans. The Java language specification and 
the Java API define the Java standards.

What is API?
Ans. API stands for The application  program  interface,  also  known  as  
library, contains  predefined  classes  and  interfaces  for  developing  Java  programs. 
The  API  is  still  expanding. 
Is Java a full-fledged language? Why?
Ans. Java is a full-fledged and powerful language that can be used in many ways.
 It comes in three editions:
 ■ Java Standard  Edition (Java  SE) to  develop  client-side  applications.  
 The  applica-tions can run standalone or as applets running from a Web browser.
 ■  Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to develop server-side applications, such as Java 
servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).
 ■ Java Micro Edition (Java ME) to develop applications for mobile devices, such as 
cell phones.

Describe JDK.
Ans. The JDK consists of a set of separate programs, each invoked from a command line, for 
developing and testing Java programs. 
What are advantages of using IDE?
Ans. Instead of using the JDK, you can use a Java devel-
opment  tool  (e.g.,  NetBeans,  Eclipse,  and  TextPad)—software  that  provides  an  
integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Java programs quickly.

Editing, compiling,building, debugging, and online help are integrated in one graphical user interface. You simply
enter source code in one window or open an existing file in a window, and then click a button 
or menu item or press a function key to compile and run the program.
